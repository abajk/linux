title: Lantiq DCDC (DC-DC converter with voltage sensor)

description:
  Lantiq DCDC is a voltage converter with a voltage sensor. The converter is
  inside the xRX200 SoC. This driver only reads the voltage and prints it at
  startup. The voltage supplied by this converter powers one of the power
  domains. It powers the CPU core and probably other peripherals as well.
